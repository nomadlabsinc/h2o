# Malloc Corruption Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Global Buffer Pool Stats (FIXED)
- **File**: `/src/h2o/buffer_pool_stats.cr`
- **Issue**: Global `@@buffer_pool_stats` was accessed concurrently by multiple clients
- **Fix**: Disabled global stats tracking by always returning `nil` from `buffer_pool_stats?`

### 2. Stream Object Pool Atomic Counter (FIXED)  
- **File**: `/src/h2o/stream.cr`
- **Issue**: Global `@@pool_size` atomic counter in StreamObjectPool
- **Fix**: Removed the global atomic variable (pooling was already disabled)

### 3. Global TLS Cache (ALREADY FIXED)
- **File**: `/src/h2o/tls_cache.cr`
- **Issue**: Global `@@tls_cache` for TLS session caching
- **Status**: Already commented out in the code

### 4. Global String Pool (ALREADY FIXED)
- **File**: `/src/h2o/string_pool.cr`
- **Issue**: Global `@@string_pool` for string interning
- **Status**: Already commented out in the code

## Test Results

### Before Fix
- H2SPEC tests: malloc corruption when running all tests
- Integration tests: malloc corruption in `content_types_spec.cr` and `status_codes_spec.cr`
- Unit tests: malloc corruption after ~173 tests

### After Fix
- H2SPEC tests: All 156 tests passing
- Integration tests: 
  - `content_types_spec.cr`: 4 tests passing
  - `status_codes_spec.cr`: 4 tests passing
  - All individual integration test files pass
- Unit tests: Still investigating remaining malloc issue

## Remaining Work

There appears to be one more malloc corruption issue that occurs when running all unit and integration tests together (after ~173 tests). This needs further investigation.

## Root Cause

The malloc corruption was caused by multiple H2O::Client instances accessing global state concurrently without proper synchronization. Even though some of these used atomic operations, the underlying data structures (like linked lists in LRU caches) were not thread-safe.

## Recommendation

For production use, all global state should be eliminated and replaced with instance-based state management. This ensures thread safety and prevents malloc corruption in concurrent environments.
