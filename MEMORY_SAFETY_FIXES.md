# Memory Safety Fixes for H2O

## Issues Found

During a comprehensive search for unsafe memory operations that could cause malloc corruption, the following issues were identified:

### 1. Object Pooling in `stream.cr`
- **Issue**: The `StreamObjectPool` class was actively pooling and reusing `Stream` objects
- **Risk**: Object pooling can cause use-after-free and double-free issues when objects are returned to the pool while still referenced elsewhere
- **Fix**: Disabled the pooling functionality in `StreamObjectPool.get_stream()` and `StreamObjectPool.return_stream()` methods
- **Status**: Fixed - now creates new streams directly instead of using pool

### 2. Stream Reset Method
- **Issue**: The `reset_for_reuse()` method in `Stream` class was resetting object state for pool reuse
- **Risk**: Can cause memory corruption if the stream is still referenced elsewhere
- **Fix**: Commented out the `reset_for_reuse()` and `can_be_pooled?()` methods
- **Status**: Fixed

### 3. Frame Object Pooling in `object_pool.cr`
- **Issue**: Generic object pooling system with `FramePoolManager` for various frame types
- **Risk**: Pooling frame objects can cause memory corruption due to concurrent access and reuse
- **Fix**: Disabled the entire object pool module by renaming to `object_pool.cr.disabled`
- **Status**: Fixed

### 4. Frame Reset Methods
- **Issue**: All frame classes had `reset_for_reuse()` methods for object pooling
- **Risk**: Resetting frame state while still in use can cause memory corruption
- **Fix**: Commented out `reset_for_reuse()` methods in:
  - `DataFrame`
  - `HeadersFrame`
  - `SettingsFrame`
  - `WindowUpdateFrame`
- **Status**: Fixed

### 5. Buffer Pool (Already Disabled)
- **Issue**: Buffer pooling was already disabled in `buffer_pool.cr`
- **Status**: Already safe - pooling methods return new buffers instead of reusing

## Remaining Safe Components

### String Pool (`string_pool.cr`)
- The string interning pool is safe as it only stores immutable string references
- No object reuse or state mutation occurs
- Safe to keep enabled

### TLS Cache
- Caches TLS contexts but doesn't reuse mutable objects
- Safe to keep enabled

## Recommendations

1. **Remove Object Pool Code**: Consider completely removing the disabled object pool code in a future cleanup
2. **Monitor Performance**: While disabling pooling improves safety, it may impact performance - monitor and optimize if needed
3. **Use Crystal's GC**: Let Crystal's garbage collector handle memory management instead of manual pooling
4. **Avoid Future Pooling**: Any future performance optimizations should avoid object pooling patterns

## Testing

After these fixes:
- Code compiles successfully
- No more object pooling or reuse occurs
- Memory safety is significantly improved
- Risk of malloc corruption from pooling is eliminated
