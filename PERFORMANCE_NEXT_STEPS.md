# H2O Performance: Next Steps for Optimization

This document outlines the next set of high-impact performance optimizations, security enhancements, and other improvements for the H2O Crystal library. Each section details a specific task, its potential benefits, a proposed solution, and a dedicated branch name for implementation.

## 1. Frame Processing Pipeline Optimization

**Branch Name**: `refactor/frame-processing-pipeline`

### 1.1. Performance Issue

The current frame processing logic handles frames one by one. While efficient, it can be further optimized by processing frames in batches and using more specialized handling for different frame types. This will reduce method call overhead and improve CPU utilization, especially under high load.

### 1.2. Proposed Fix

- **Batch Frame Operations**: Implement a mechanism to read and process multiple frames from the I/O buffer at once, reducing the number of read cycles and fiber context switches.
- **Frame Type-Specific Buffer Sizing**: Allocate buffers sized appropriately for the specific frame type being processed, avoiding over-allocation and reducing memory pressure. For example, `SETTINGS` frames are small and predictable, while `DATA` frames can be large and variable.
- **Optimized Frame Header Parsing**: Replace generic parsing logic with a lookup table or a highly optimized case statement for frame header parsing, which can significantly speed up frame identification.

### 1.3. Required Tests

- **Unit Tests**:
    - A test to verify that batch processing correctly handles a sequence of different frame types.
    - Tests to ensure that type-specific buffer sizing allocates and uses memory correctly.
    - A benchmark to measure the performance gain from the optimized frame header parsing.
- **Integration Tests**:
    - An integration test that sends a high-throughput stream of mixed frames to a server to validate the stability and performance of the new pipeline under load.
- **Regression Tests**:
    - Performance benchmarks that compare the frame processing throughput and latency before and after the changes.

### Checklist for LLM

- [ ] Implement batch frame reading and processing logic in `H2O::Client`.
- [ ] Introduce frame type-specific buffer allocation and management.
- [ ] Refactor frame header parsing to use a more performant approach.
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests to cover the new functionality.
- [ ] Run and document performance benchmarks to prove the improvement.

## 2. TLS/Certificate Optimization

**Branch Name**: `feature/tls-certificate-caching`

### 2.1. Performance Issue

TLS handshakes are computationally expensive. Currently, a full handshake may be performed for each new connection to a host, even if a connection was recently established. Caching TLS session tickets and certificate validation results can dramatically reduce this overhead for subsequent connections to the same host.

### 2.2. Proposed Fix

- **Certificate Validation Caching**: Implement an in-memory cache (e.g., `LRU::Cache`) to store the validation results of certificates for a certain period. This avoids repeated validation for the same hosts.
- **TLS Session Resumption**: Implement support for TLS session resumption using session tickets (RFC 5077). This allows clients and servers to resume a previous session without performing a full handshake.
- **Optimized SNI Handling**: Cache Server Name Indication (SNI) results per host to avoid redundant lookups.

### 2.3. Required Tests

- **Unit Tests**:
    - A test to verify that certificate validation results are correctly cached and retrieved.
    - A test to ensure that TLS session tickets are properly handled and used for session resumption.
- **Integration Tests**:
    - An integration test that connects to a TLS server multiple times and asserts that session resumption occurs on subsequent connections.
    - A test with an invalid or expired certificate to ensure the caching logic doesn't interfere with security validation.
- **Security Tests**:
    - A test to ensure that cached items are properly expired and that the cache size is limited to prevent memory exhaustion.

### Checklist for LLM

- [ ] Implement a cache for certificate validation results.
- [ ] Add logic to the TLS client to support and utilize session resumption.
- [ ] Add tests to validate the caching and session resumption functionality.
- [ ] Ensure the implementation is secure and does not introduce vulnerabilities.

## 3. Advanced Memory Management

**Branch Name**: `feature/advanced-memory-management`

### 3.1. Performance Issue

While buffer pooling has significantly reduced memory allocations, there are still opportunities for improvement, especially in reducing GC pressure and managing memory more efficiently for frequently created objects.

### 3.2. Proposed Fix

- **Object Pooling**: Implement object pooling for frequently created and discarded objects, such as `H2O::Stream` or `H2O::Frames::Frame` subclasses. This can reduce the overhead of object allocation and garbage collection.
- **String Interning**: For common strings, such as standard HTTP header names, implement a string interning mechanism to ensure that only one copy of each string is stored in memory.
- **Vectorized Operations (SIMD)**: For performance-critical code paths that involve byte manipulation (e.g., XOR masking in WebSockets, frame parsing), explore the use of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations to process data in parallel at the CPU level. This is an advanced optimization that can yield significant performance gains.

### 3.3. Required Tests

- **Unit Tests**:
    - Tests to verify that the object pools are working correctly and that objects are properly reset before being reused.
    - A test to confirm that string interning reduces allocations for repeated strings.
- **Performance Tests**:
    - Benchmarks that measure the impact of object pooling on allocation rates and GC pauses.
    - Benchmarks that demonstrate the performance improvement from SIMD-optimized operations compared to the standard implementation.

### Checklist for LLM

- [ ] Implement an object pool for `H2O::Stream` objects.
- [ ] Introduce a string interning mechanism for common HTTP headers.
- [ ] Research and apply SIMD optimizations to a critical byte-processing function.
- [ ] Add benchmarks to quantify the performance improvements.

## 4. I/O and Protocol-Level Optimizations

**Branch Name**: `feature/io-protocol-optimizations`

### 4.1. Performance Issue

The current I/O operations are robust, but there are advanced techniques that can further improve performance by reducing data copying and system calls. Additionally, the HTTP/2 protocol itself has features that can be optimized.

### 4.2. Proposed Fix

- **Zero-Copy I/O**: Where possible, implement zero-copy I/O operations to avoid copying data between the kernel and user space. This can be particularly effective for serving large files.
- **I/O Operation Batching**: Batch multiple small write operations into a single system call to reduce overhead.
- **Optimized Flow Control**: Implement more adaptive flow control window management, which can improve throughput on high-latency networks.
- **HPACK Dynamic Table Presets**: For clients that communicate with the same server frequently, consider adding an option to pre-populate the HPACK dynamic table with a set of common headers to improve compression efficiency from the very first request.

### 4.3. Required Tests

- **Unit Tests**:
    - A test to verify that batched I/O operations are correctly written to the socket.
- **Integration Tests**:
    - An integration test that uses zero-copy I/O to serve a file and measures the performance gain.
    - A test that validates the adaptive flow control mechanism under various network conditions (e.g., using a tool like `tc` to simulate latency).
- **Performance Tests**:
    - Benchmarks that compare the performance of I/O operations with and without these optimizations.

### Checklist for LLM

- [ ] Implement I/O operation batching in the client's write loop.
- [ ] Investigate and implement a zero-copy mechanism for file transfers.
- [ ] Refactor the flow control logic to be more adaptive.
- [ ] Add an API to allow pre-populating the HPACK dynamic table.
- [ ] Add tests and benchmarks for all new features.
