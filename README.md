# h2o

A high-performance HTTP/2 client for Crystal with full protocol compliance, connection pooling, and advanced features like HPACK compression and stream multiplexing. Optimized for production use with comprehensive CI testing.

## Development Attribution

This project was developed heavily with the assistance of Claude Opus and Claude Sonnet 4. The codebase is largely (99%) generated by Claude Code through extensive collaboration, careful prompting, and iterative validation.

**Important Notice**: While this library is actively used in production environments and has been tested against multiple APIs and HTTP/2 endpoints, it should be considered experimental. This code represents the result of extensive AI-assisted development with careful validation and testing, but was not written by an expert in the HTTP/2 protocol or the Crystal programming language.

All functionality included in this library, including the Circuit Breaker and Circuit Breaker Persistence Adapters, are currently in use in production environments but should be considered somewhat experimental. Users should thoroughly test and validate the library for their specific use cases before production deployment.

## Features

- 🚀 **Full HTTP/2 Support**: Complete implementation of RFC 7540
- 🔐 **TLS with ALPN**: Automatic HTTP/2 negotiation via TLS ALPN
- 🗜️ **HPACK Compression**: RFC 7541 compliant header compression
- 🔀 **Stream Multiplexing**: Concurrent request handling over single connection
- 🏊 **Connection Pooling**: Efficient connection reuse and management
- 📊 **Flow Control**: Both connection and stream-level flow control
- ⚡ **High Performance**: Optimized for speed and low memory usage
- 🧪 **Comprehensive Tests**: Full test coverage with integration tests
- 🔄 **Circuit Breaker**: Built-in circuit breaker pattern for resilience

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  h2o:
    github: nomadlabsinc/h2o
    branch: main
```

Then run:

```bash
shards install
```

## Quick Start

```crystal
require "h2o"

# Create a client
client = H2O::Client.new

# Make a simple GET request
response = client.get("https://httpbin.org/get")
puts response.status  # => 200
puts response.body    # => JSON response

# Make a POST request with body
headers = H2O::Headers.new
headers["content-type"] = "application/json"
body = %q({"key": "value"})

response = client.post("https://httpbin.org/post", body, headers)
puts response.status  # => 200

# Clean up
client.close
```

## Basic Usage

### Connection Pooling

```crystal
client = H2O::Client.new(connection_pool_size: 20)
```

### Request Timeouts

```crystal
client = H2O::Client.new(timeout: 10.seconds)
```

### Custom Headers

```crystal
headers = H2O::Headers.new
headers["authorization"] = "Bearer your-token"
response = client.get("https://api.example.com/protected", headers)
```

### HTTP Methods

```crystal
client = H2O::Client.new

response = client.get("https://api.example.com/users")
response = client.post("https://api.example.com/users", body)
response = client.put("https://api.example.com/users/1", body)
response = client.delete("https://api.example.com/users/1")
response = client.head("https://api.example.com/users")
response = client.options("https://api.example.com/users")
response = client.patch("https://api.example.com/users/1", body)
```
