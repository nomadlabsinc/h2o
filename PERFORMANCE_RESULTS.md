## GitHub Issue #40 Resolution

### Core Problem Resolution:
- **HTTP/2 Timeout Issue**: Fixed fiber race condition in connection setup
- **Nil Response Problem**: Implemented comprehensive Response object type safety
- **Connection Reliability**: Enhanced error handling and connection management
- **Type Safety**: Eliminated nullable Response types throughout codebase

### Root Cause Analysis:
**Problem**: HTTP/2 requests were timing out and returning nil due to a fiber race condition where server responses were lost because fibers weren't started before sending the HTTP/2 preface.

**Solution**: Added `ensure_fibers_started` call in `setup_connection()` method before sending HTTP/2 preface, ensuring proper fiber lifecycle management.

**Impact**: This fix resolved the core timeout issue and improved connection reliability.
