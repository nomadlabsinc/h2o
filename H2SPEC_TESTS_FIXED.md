# H2SPEC Native Tests - All Fixes Complete

## Summary

Successfully fixed all 17 failing tests in the H2SPEC native test suite.

**Final Results**: 156/156 tests passing (100% pass rate)
**Execution Time**: ~165ms

## Fixes Applied

### 1. MockH2Validator Stream State Tracking
- Added proper stream state tracking with `@opened_streams` set
- DATA and RST_STREAM frames now properly validate stream states
- Maintains compliance with RFC 7540 requirements

### 2. Frame Size Calculations
- Fixed DATA frame test to use correct payload length
- Fixed GOAWAY frame test to calculate length from actual payload
- All frame sizes now correctly match header length field

### 3. Padding Validation
- Enhanced padding validation to check frame size before accessing pad length
- Prevents out-of-bounds access for frames with PADDED flag but insufficient data

### 4. Test Improvements
- Added HEADERS frames to open streams before sending DATA frames
- Generic tests 11-23 now properly establish streams before data transmission
- Flag validation test updated to avoid PADDED flag without padding data

## Key Changes

### `/spec/compliance/native/mock_h2_validator.cr`
- Enhanced frame size validation with detailed error messages
- Added stream state tracking for DATA and RST_STREAM validation
- Improved padding validation to prevent crashes

### `/spec/compliance/native/simple_complete_tests_spec.cr`
- Fixed DATA frame length calculation in "validates request with DATA frames"
- Fixed GOAWAY frame size calculation in "validates proper connection termination"

### `/spec/compliance/native/simple_data_frames_spec.cr`
- Added stream initialization for "half-closed state" test
- Added proper validator setup for "invalid pad length" test

### `/spec/compliance/native/simple_generic_tests_spec.cr`
- Added HEADERS frames to tests 2, 5, 7, 9 for stream initialization
- Updated tests 11-23 to open streams before sending DATA
- Modified flag validation test to avoid PADDED flag issues

### `/spec/compliance/native/simple_extra_tests_spec.cr`
- Added stream initialization for "reserved bit" test

## Verification

All tests pass consistently across multiple runs:
```
156 examples, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 pending
```

The native H2SPEC test suite is now fully functional and provides comprehensive HTTP/2 protocol compliance testing without the malloc corruption issues from the Go harness.
