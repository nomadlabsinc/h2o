# H2O HTTP/2 Compliance Test Results

## Summary

Based on the partial test run (95 out of 146 tests completed before timeout):

- **Tests Run**: 95
- **Passed**: 82 (86.3%)
- **Failed**: 13 (13.7%)

## Detailed Results

### Passing Tests ✅

   - 3.5/2: Invalid connection preface handling

3. **Frame Format** (3/3 passing)
   - 4.1/1: Unknown frame types
   - 4.1/2: Invalid flags
   - 4.1/3: Reserved bits

4. **Frame Size** (3/3 passing)
   - 4.2/1: Oversized DATA frames
   - 4.2/2: Oversized HEADERS frames
   - 4.2/3: Invalid frame sizes

5. **Stream States** (13/13 passing)
   - All stream state transition tests
   - Closed stream handling
   - IDLE state handling

6. **Stream Identifiers** (2/2 passing)
   - Even stream ID rejection
   - Zero stream ID handling

7. **Flow Control** (3/3 passing)
   - WINDOW_UPDATE handling
   - Flow control violations

8. **Core Frame Types**
   - DATA frames (3/3 passing)
   - HEADERS frames (4/4 passing)
   - PRIORITY frames (2/2 passing)
   - RST_STREAM frames (3/3 passing)
   - SETTINGS frames (6/6 passing)
   - PING frames (3/3 passing)
   - GOAWAY frames (1/3 passing)

### Failing Tests ❌

The following tests failed (mostly due to connection issues):

1. **HPACK Tests** (6 failures)
   - hpack/6.1/2
   - hpack/6.3/2-6
   - hpack/misc/2

2. **Connection Issues** (7 failures)
   - generic/3.4/1
   - 4.3/1
   - 5.5/1
   - 6.3/3
   - 6.5.3/1
   - 6.8/2-3

## Key Findings

1. **Core Protocol Compliance**: The h2o client demonstrates strong compliance with core HTTP/2 protocol requirements

2. **Error Handling**: The client properly handles many error conditions including:
   - Invalid frame formats
   - Protocol violations
   - Stream state errors
   - Flow control violations

3. **HPACK Issues**: Some HPACK (header compression) tests revealed issues:
   - Invalid header index errors
   - Unexpected end of data in string decoding
   - These indicate potential bugs in the HPACK decoder implementation

4. **Connection Stability**: Some tests failed due to connection issues, possibly due to:
   - Docker container cleanup issues
   - Port conflicts from rapid test execution
   - Tests that intentionally break connections

## Recommendations

1. **Fix HPACK Decoder Issues**:
   - Handle invalid header indices gracefully
   - Improve string decoding error handling
   - Add bounds checking for dynamic table access

2. **Improve Test Infrastructure**:
   - Add retry logic for connection failures
   - Ensure proper container cleanup between tests
   - Add longer delays for container initialization

3. **Continue Testing**:
   - Run remaining 51 tests
   - Re-run failed tests individually to isolate issues
   - Add logging to understand specific failure modes

## Conclusion

With an 86.3% pass rate on the tests completed, the h2o HTTP/2 client shows good overall compliance with the HTTP/2 specification. The main areas needing attention are HPACK decoder robustness and test infrastructure reliability.
