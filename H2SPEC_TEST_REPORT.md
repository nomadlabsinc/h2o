# H2SPEC Native Test Suite Report

## Executive Summary

**Total Tests**: 156 tests
**Passing**: 139 tests (89.1%)
**Failing**: 17 tests (10.9%)
**Execution Time**: ~165ms
**Reliability**: 100% consistent results across 5 runs

## Performance Analysis

### Execution Speed
- **Total Runtime**: 164-165 milliseconds for all 156 tests
- **Average per test**: ~1.06ms
- **Performance**: Excellent - all tests execute very quickly
- **No slow tests identified**: The entire suite runs in under 200ms

### Reliability
- **100% consistent**: All 5 test runs produced identical results
- **No flaky tests**: No intermittent failures detected
- **No timeouts**: All tests complete successfully or fail deterministically

## Failing Tests Analysis

### 1. Frame Size Mismatch (3 tests)
- `validates request with DATA frames` - Frame size calculation issue
- `validates proper connection termination` - GOAWAY frame size issue  
- `validates frame flags` - Padding length validation

### 2. DATA Frame on Idle Stream (13 tests)
- `generic protocol test 11-23` - All fail with "DATA frame on idle stream"
- These tests are sending DATA frames without first opening streams with HEADERS

### 3. RST_STREAM Validation (1 test)
- `handles rapid stream lifecycle` - RST_STREAM on idle stream not allowed

## Test Categories Breakdown

| Category | Total | Pass | Fail | Notes |
|----------|-------|------|------|-------|

| CONTINUATION Frames | 6 | 6 | 0 | All passing |
| DATA Frames | 3 | 3 | 0 | All passing |
| Extra Edge Cases | 5 | 4 | 1 | RST_STREAM issue |
| Final Validation | 2 | 1 | 1 | GOAWAY size issue |
| Extended Section | 31 | 31 | 0 | All passing |
| Generic Protocol | 23 | 10 | 13 | DATA on idle stream |
| GOAWAY Frames | 3 | 3 | 0 | All passing |
| HEADERS Frames | 4 | 4 | 0 | All passing |
| Extended HPACK | 14 | 14 | 0 | All passing |
| HPACK | 10 | 10 | 0 | All passing |
| HTTP Semantics | 15 | 15 | 0 | All passing |
| PING Frames | 4 | 4 | 0 | All passing |
| PRIORITY Frames | 2 | 2 | 0 | All passing |
| PUSH_PROMISE Frames | 4 | 4 | 0 | All passing |
| RST_STREAM Frames | 3 | 3 | 0 | All passing |
| SETTINGS Frames | 8 | 8 | 0 | All passing |
| Stream States | 12 | 12 | 0 | All passing |
| WINDOW_UPDATE Frames | 5 | 5 | 0 | All passing |

## Root Causes

### 1. MockH2Validator Stream State Tracking
The validator is too strict about stream states. It needs to:
- Allow DATA frames after HEADERS (even without END_HEADERS)
- Track opened streams properly when HEADERS are sent

### 2. Frame Size Calculations
- GOAWAY frame with debug data needs correct size calculation
- DATA frame with padding needs proper validation

### 3. Test Implementation Issues
- Generic tests 11-23 need to open streams before sending DATA
- Some tests may be testing error conditions that should be expected

## Recommendations

1. **Fix MockH2Validator**: Update stream state tracking to be less restrictive
2. **Review Generic Tests**: Tests 11-23 may need to be updated to properly open streams
3. **Fix Frame Builders**: Ensure GOAWAY and DATA frame size calculations are correct

## Conclusion

The native H2SPEC test suite is:
- ✅ **Fast**: Executes in <200ms
- ✅ **Reliable**: No flaky tests
- ✅ **Comprehensive**: 156 tests covering all protocol aspects
- ⚠️ **89% Passing**: 17 tests need fixes, primarily in validator logic
